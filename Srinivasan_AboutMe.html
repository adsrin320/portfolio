          <p> Hello, my name is Advaith Srinivasan. I am a ninth grader at 
          Dublin High School in California. I am fourteen years old and I want 
          to become a computer science engineer in the future so I am taking 
          Computer Science Principles as my elective in ninth grade. Ever since
          first grade, I been into computers and wondered how they work. Now 
          that I have that I have the chance, I took it and embraced it. 
          <br> <br> I am a member of Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA),
          where we are trying help local companies expand their business. I 
          believe that I am patient, productive, and helpful. I am good team
          worker and can easily get along with people. I have been on two 
          basketball teams and I made sure everyone knew what their role was
          and what they were doing. I have lead my team to the semifinals where
          we lost in overtime. <br> <br>
          Since technology in the world is rapidly changing, and I want to help 
          the future by making sure that everything goes right. Thank you for 
          spending your time reading this and please check out the rest of my 
          portfolio.
