        <p>This was a scratch project done by me and my partner, Shashank, 
         where we tried to create a platform jump game. Our game had a
         character that float arounds the game. Due to lack of time and the
         jump mechanics being glitchy, we couldn't how we wanted our project to
         be. In the beginning of the project, we couldn't get the character to 
         jump and we had to try many ways to make the character jump. My main
         role was to keep the notebook organized and code the project. In this
         project, I learned that even forgetting one line code of can mess up 
         everything. I also learned how to make the basics for a scratch game.

            This was a app that my partner, Julia, and I created using MIT App
            Inventor. We created an app that lets you draw on a canvas or on a 
            picture. We created a slider where the user can choose what color 
            they want to use, a slider for the thickness of the ink, a camera 
            to insert a photo, and a clear button. We encountered many 
            different kind of problems from the line thickness not immediately 
            changing to not making the picture stretch after you insert it. We 
            both woked on it trying to solve whatever came in the way. My main
            role was to make sure that the notebok was organized and help code. 
            I learned how much we had to do just to get a simple feature to 
            work. I also learned that even a single block of code can ruin a 
            feature.
